    .. warning::
        The ``color`` must be different than black. 
        The color black is used to represent no data.

        rgb_img (numpy.ndarray): Image to convert in a single color, of size :math:`(H, W, 3)`.
        color (tuple): RGB color, in the format :math:`(R, G, B)`.

#! Update this function as currently ImageChop.add only add color together and do not overwrite them
